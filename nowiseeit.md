## Abstract

## Introduction

One of the primary aims of Clinical Practice Guidelines is to communicate the best available evidence to healthcare practitioners so that they can translate that information into optimal quality of care. <!-- ref -->Despite this aim, Clinical Practice Guidelines are all but user friendly. Specifically, while most clinicians look for simple graphics that might guide their practice, most Clinical Practice Guidelines bring together a massive amount of information on methods, ratings, contradictions in the literature, among other pieces of information that are irrelevant at the point of care. In contrast with this overall confusion, infographics aim bringing clarity to complex information, its use in healthcare being more and more widespread<!-- ref -->, thus opening opportunities to its use in the education of Clinical Practice Guidelines.

The objective of this article was therefore to conduct a mixed methods study, combining (1) a qualitative study  evaluating which characteristics of a wide variety of infographics elicited which types of responses among a group of healthcare providers and (2) a factorial randomized controlled trial comparing <!-- will not describe the intervention since it will be defined through the qualitative evaluation -->



## Methods

This is a mixed methods study where we initiated with a qualitative evaluation of different types of infographic display of a Clinical Practice Guideline, followed by a factorial randomized controlled trial. Both studies are described below following, respectively, the <!-- ref --> and the [CONSORT Statement, version 2010]().
